Running the Code
****************
-I set up a Makefile to facilitate running the code.  Of course you don't have to use it if you don't want to, but I'll be describing how to use it.
-using the Makefile to solve the 3 questions:
	-Question 4:
		-relevant code is in Prob4.java, EMRecord.java, and EMParam1.java
		-output for first bullet point (top 10 matching german words) is in data/dev.matches
			-generate by running "make data/dev.matches" in terminal
		-output for 2nd bullet point (alignments for first 20 pairs) is in data/ibm1.aligns
			-generate by running "make data/ibm1.aligns" in terminal
	-Question 5:
		-relevant code is in Prob5.java, EM2Result.java
		-output is in data/ibm2.aligns
			-generate by running "make data/ibm2.aligns" in terminal
	-Question 6:
		-relevant code is in Prob6.java, EM2Result.java
		-output is in data/unscrambled.en
			-generate by running "make data/unscrambled.en" in terminal
		-to print evaluation to console, run "make eval"
	-to get rid of any artifacts, run "make clean"

Performance/Efficiency
**********************
-Question 4 (IBM Model 1)
	-44 seconds for 5 iterations
	-resulting alignments resemble sample
		-eyeball estimate: 50%

-Question 5 (IBM Model 2)
	-81 seconds for 5 iterations
	-resulting alignments resemble sample
-Question 6
	-6 seconds once IBM Model 2 is done
	-5% accuracy :(

************
Observations
************
-Question 6
	-one issue was what to do with english or french words not seen in the corpora
