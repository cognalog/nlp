Running the Code
****************
-I set up a Makefile to facilitate running the code.  Of course you don't have to use it if you don't want to, but I'll be describing how to use it.
-using the Makefile to solve the 3 questions
	-Question 4:
		-run "make data/rare.counts" in the main directory (using unix terminal)
		-output: rare.counts and rares.dat
			-rares.dat is essentially parse_train.dat with rare (count < 5) words replaced by _RARE_
			-rare.counts is the result of running the provided counting script on rares.dat
		-each file ends up in the data/ directory
	-Question 5
		-run "make eval5" in the main directory (using unix terminal)
		-output: cky.results and cky.eval
			-cky.results contains the parse trees generated for parse_dev.dat by my cky implementation
			-cky.eval contains the result of running the provided evaluation script on cky.results
		-each file ends up in the data/ directory
	-Question 6
		-run "make eval6" in the main directory (using unix terminal)
		-output: vr.results and vr.eval, in addition to some intermediate files
			-similar to the output of Solution 5, but using markovized rules
		-each file ends up in the data/ directory

Performance
***********
-Question 5
	-9.8 minutes
	-score: 0.714 precision, recall and f-score
-Question 6
	-15 minutes
	-score: 0.742 precision, recall and f-score

************
Observations
************
-Question 5
	-_RARE_ likelihood may have been disproportionately high
		-more specific classification would be better
	-using log sums instead of actual products in cky dramatically lowers score
		-underflow is not an issue
-Question 6
	-same issue with log sums and rares
	-scores are better across the board
	-takes a bit more time
